# cpp-util

Collection of C++ utilities for different projects. 

Sub folders are categories for these utilities and may 
contain one or more utility classes.

All utilities are not perfectly written in performance or
code-wise. This repository is mostly for me to remember
the C++ syntax and functions and also to learn new stuff
on the way. 

All utilities are licensed under MIT so you are free to use 
them as you like. 

If you want to support this, you can always throw few
satoshis (Bitcoins) to:
